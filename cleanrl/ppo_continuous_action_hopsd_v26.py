# HOPSD v26 — plan-phi: hindsight windows built from POLICY MEANS, not sampled actions.
# =====================================================================================
# v25/v25.1 autopsy (both dead, entropy -12..-16): sigma-normalization did NOT fix the
# spiral, falsifying the boundary-ratchet story. The real mechanism is the LEAK LAW's
# third instance: a persistent exploration deviation is READABLE in the near-window
# mean of future sampled actions, so the teacher learns to predict the noise state
# itself, sharpens toward a delta at the realized action, and distillation collapses
# the student onto its own noise (v22 = inverse-dynamics leak, v15 = smoothness leak,
# v25 = noise-persistence leak). White noise was never a weakness — it is what made
# sampled-action windows safe.
# Repair that benefits BOTH regimes: build phi from the policy MEANS mu_{t+k} (env
# scale) instead of sampled actions. The windows then describe the intended plan —
# trajectory structure preserved, execution noise invisible. This (a) removes the
# residual v15 smoothness-jitter channel even under white noise, and (b) makes
# AR(1)-coherent exploration compatible with hindsight context, since the noise no
# longer appears in phi at all. explore_rho defaults to 0 here (white noise); the
# rho>0 arm only runs if mean-phi alone is healthy.
# Tell if plan-phi is WEAKER than realized-phi: the windows lose the information that
# distinguishes executed good tail behavior from the plan — teacher_nll rises,
# returns land at/below no-phi 4726. Read @1.5M vs v19 5531 / control 5288.
# =====================================================================================
#
# --- v25.1 mechanism (retained below; explore_rho=0 disables it) ---
# =====================================================================================
# v25 autopsy (rho 0.6/0.85/0.95 ALL at NEGATIVE returns, student entropy -12..-14):
# the deviation was carried in absolute z units with a boundary clamp. Once dev grew,
# z pinned at the boundary, explore_dev = z - mean stayed huge, and the ratchet held
# max-torque actions for whole episodes; the teacher MLE then imitated those realized
# extremes, the tilt picked the least-bad one, the student collapsed onto it, and the
# policy mean itself migrated to the boundary. Saturation x imitation death spiral.
# Fix: carry a UNITLESS AR(1) state e_t per (env, dim):
#   e_t = rho*e_{t-1}*(1-reset) + sqrt(1-rho^2) * (z_iid - mean_t)/std_t,
#   e_t clamped to +/- explore_e_max (2.5 sigma),  z_t = mean_t + std_t * e_t.
# The carried deviation now scales with the CURRENT state's policy spread: as the
# policy sharpens, probes shrink with it; no boundary ratchet, realized z stays within
# ~2.5 sigma of the policy so the MLE only ever sees plausible samples. rho=0 == v19.
# =====================================================================================
#
# --- v25 rationale (retained below; mechanism superseded) ---
# The champion explores with WHITE noise — iid Beta samples every step. On a 20-step
# hindsight horizon white noise averages itself out: the phi windows mostly see
# jitter canceling to the policy mean, and the tilt must find signal in what survives.
# v25 makes exploration temporally coherent: per (env, dim), the deviation from the
# policy mean follows an AR(1) process, dev_t = rho*dev_{t-1} + sqrt(1-rho^2)*dev_iid,
# where dev_iid comes from the policy's own Beta sample (state-dependent scale
# preserved); z_t = clamp(mean_t + dev_t). Deviations persist ~1/(1-rho) steps —
# coherent behavioral probes, not per-step dither.
# Why this architecture uniquely tolerates it: the student learns by KL distillation
# and the teacher by weighted MLE on REALIZED z — neither needs behavior == nominal
# policy (no live importance ratios; the leash is inert diagnostics). PPO proper
# cannot do this without off-policy corrections; HOPSD can, for free.
# The synergy hypothesis: a persistent deviation IS what the near/far window means
# detect. White noise makes phi carry ~zero exploration information; AR(1) exploration
# makes the windows encode WHICH coherent probe was running, so the tilt can credit
# whole probes rather than single-step twitches. Exploration and hindsight privilege
# finally point at each other.
# Reset on episode boundary. rho=0 recovers v19 exactly. Dose arms: rho 0.6/0.85/0.95.
# Read @1.5M vs v19 5531 / control 5288. Tell for "too coherent": episodic return
# variance up + returns down early (probes too long = worse average control).
# =====================================================================================
#
# --- v19 phi-windows (retained below) ---
# The phi ablation ladder: no-phi 4726 < single-window pooled 5288 (privilege is worth
# ~10%); but RAW ordered lags (v15) fell to 4107 — per-step future actions correlate
# with a_t through policy smoothness, so they inject target jitter, not gait signal.
# v19 threads the needle: split the 20-step future window into NEAR (a_{t+1..t+5}) and
# FAR (a_{t+6..t+20}) and pool mean/std WITHIN each. Pooling keeps each window
# denoised and permutation-invariant (the property that works); the near/far SPLIT
# restores exactly one bit of temporal order — the trajectory's direction of drift,
# near-vs-far contrast = where the gait is heading — which the single window
# provably destroys and which raw lags delivered too noisily. Context grows 2A+1 ->
# 4A+1 for both teacher inputs (conditioning stays equalized). Everything else is
# byte-identical to v12.2 (winsorized KL-targeted tilt @ 1.2).
# Watch vs control (2206@500k / 4159@1M / 5288@1.5M): if near/far contrast carries
# improvement signal, returns beat control with teacher_student_mean_gap modestly up;
# if it re-imports the v15 jitter, distill_kl inflates toward 0.3 and returns sag —
# the diagnostic pair separates the two failure stories cleanly.
# =====================================================================================
#
# --- v12.2 method (retained below) ---
# v12's autopsy (0.9M): real GAE advantage batches have extreme outliers; the unclamped
# softmax bisection let a handful of samples eat the whole 1.2-nat KL budget, so the
# dual INFLATED temp (0.60->1.03) to protect the target — flattening the tilt for the
# useful bulk — and the safety clamp then truncated those outliers anyway, collapsing
# realized KL to 0.35. Effective tilt ended WEAKER than the champion's 0.90 nats.
# Meanwhile the clamp-shaped w50 arm leads the fleet: the clamp is not safety, it IS
# the robustness mechanism (clamp at w_max == winsorizing adv_z at temp*ln(w_max);
# w50@temp0.4 == clip at +1.56 sigma, then pure exp tilt on the bulk).
# v12.2 keeps the KL-targeted dual but makes it robust the same way: winsorize adv_z at
# +/- adv_clip (2.0 sigma) FIRST, then bisect temp on the clipped distribution and take
# weights as N*softmax (numerically stable, no post-hoc weight clamp — realized KL now
# equals the target identically). Outliers can't eat the budget; the bulk gets the full
# tilt; tilt_eps is a trustworthy dose dial again. Arms: eps 1.2 (shape control vs w50
# at matched strength) and eps 1.8 (dose escalation, now safe to read).
# Prediction: eps 1.2 arm ~= w50 (>= v10_noleash matched-step); eps 1.8 >= both if
# operator strength is still the binding lever. Watch debug/auto_temp (should now FALL
# as the policy sharpens), debug/awr_ess, debug/clip_frac_adv.
# =====================================================================================
#
# --- v12 method (retained below) ---
# Base = pure no-leash champion config (v2, target_kl inert). Single change: the AWR
# temperature is no longer a fixed constant. Each iteration, geometric bisection finds
# the temp whose softmax tilt over the batch advantages sits at a fixed KL from the
# data distribution: KL(softmax(A/temp) || uniform) = tilt_eps. This is the sample-based
# MPO E-step constraint — the improvement step gets a CONSTANT information size in
# distribution space, instead of whatever exp(A/0.5).clamp(20) happens to produce as
# the advantage distribution's shape drifts over training.
# Calibration (N(0,1) advantages, N=32k): the champion's effective tilt (temp 0.5,
# clamp 20) is KL ~= 0.90, and the clamp — not the temp — is the binding controller
# below temp ~0.5 (temps 0.5/0.4/0.3 all land at KL ~= 0.9). Default tilt_eps = 1.2:
# modestly stronger than the champion (evidence says operator strength is binding),
# equal in strength to the temp0.4+w50 clamp arm launched alongside — so the pair
# tests tilt SHAPE (softmax vs clamp-truncated) at matched strength, and v12 adds
# adaptivity. Weights are N*softmax (mean 1, same normalization as before); the old
# clamp is retained only as a loose safety at 200. Logs: debug/auto_temp,
# debug/tilt_kl_realized. Prediction: auto_temp starts ~0.6 and FALLS as the policy
# sharpens (advantage spread shrinks -> constraint loosens temp); matched-step
# returns >= v10_noleash. Risk: softmax tail domination (few samples own the tilt) —
# watch debug/awr_ess.
# =====================================================================================
#
# --- v2 method (retained below) ---
# v2 = v1 with the outcome grade g (z-scored lambda-return) REMOVED from the teacher-
# actor context (teacher_sees_g=False toggle; the teacher critic never saw it). v1 hit
# the predicted degenerate fixed point at 2M (return -86 vs baseline 5012): distill_kl
# 0.019, teacher-student mean gap 0.009, approx_kl 0.0025 — the teacher collapsed to
# posterior reconstruction of the student. Cause: with g in the context the advantage is
# nearly a FUNCTION of the context, so the AWR weight exp(adv_z) is ~constant within
# each context; it reweights which contexts get fit but never tilts the conditional
# toward better-than-taken actions. With g removed, advantage varies within a context
# and the weighting tilts the teacher's conditional — the teacher becomes a genuine
# hindsight-conditioned improvement operator (AWR expressed through a privileged
# rationalizer). Everything else == v1.
# =====================================================================================
#
# --- v1 method (retained below) ---
# Port of On-Policy Self-Distillation onto the iterthink_v24_beta_d3bucket_mtp base
# (config of the ppoadvnorm_batch_v1 run: raw GAE, batch-scope z-scoring). OPSD's LLM
# recipe: a TEACHER conditioned on privileged info (the verified solution) and a STUDENT
# conditioned on the problem only; the student rolls out; at every position the loss is
# per-position forward KL(teacher || student) over the FULL distribution, with pointwise
# per-entry clipping min(l, tau); gradients flow only through the student. Dense
# distillation replaces sparse-reward RL.
#
# RL translation (no verified answer exists, so hindsight is the privilege):
#   TEACHER ACTOR  pi_T(a_t | s_t, phi_t): a separate ThinkTrunk that sees the realized
#     future phi_t over the next H=20 steps (~ GAE effective horizon 1/(1-gamma*lambda)):
#     future-action mean/std per dim (a_{t+1..t+H}; a_t excluded so the teacher cannot be
#     an identity map), the z-scored lambda-return g_t ("returns for the horizon"), and
#     the valid-horizon fraction. Trained by ADVANTAGE-WEIGHTED Beta NLL on the taken
#     native z: w = exp(adv_z/awr_temp).clamp(w_max), mean-normalized. The weighting is
#     the improvement operator (AWR): given hindsight, the teacher fits "the action that
#     should have been taken", not merely the action that was taken. Rationalization
#     (fit a_t given what followed) is far easier than generation — the paper's core bet.
#   TEACHER CRITIC V_T(s_t, gait_t): a separate ThinkTrunk over [obs, future-action
#     mean/std, valid frac] (NO return features — with them it degenerates into a return
#     copier). HL-Gauss CE to lambda-returns; a horizon-Q "V(s, plan)". v1 role:
#     diagnostic (its EV measures how informative the privileged plan summary is).
#   STUDENT: the unchanged base agent (shared ThinkTrunk -> Beta actor + Dreamer3-bucket
#     511-bin HL-Gauss MTP critic). Its actor objective is ONLY the dense distillation
#     loss sum_d min(KL(Beta_T,d || Beta_S,d), tau) at every rollout state, teacher
#     detached — PPO (ratio/clip/advantages in the actor loss) is fully removed. The
#     critic keeps its raw-return CE loss (it anchors GAE -> adv_z, g). target_kl stays
#     as a drift leash (epoch early-stop off replayed-z logprobs), not as an objective.
#
# Faithful-to-paper choices: forward KL (their decisive winner over reverse KL/JSD);
# full-distribution matching (closed-form Beta KL = the "full-vocab logit" analog);
# pointwise per-dim clipping (their per-vocab-entry min(l, tau)); teacher evaluated at
# the ACHIEVED hindsight context on every student state (no elites, no relabeling);
# gradients only through the student. Deviations forced by RL-from-scratch: the teacher
# must learn online (no frozen-at-init teacher) and needs the AWR weighting because a
# rollout future, unlike a verified solution, is not necessarily good.
#
# HYPOTHESIS: hindsight rationalization + advantage weighting make the teacher a
# per-state full-distribution target that is denser and lower-variance than PPO's
# clipped surrogate, so the student improves at every state including bad ones.
# Falsifiable: if the teacher is just posterior reconstruction (no improvement), the
# student converges to self-BC and returns plateau far below the PPO baseline
# (ppoadvnorm_batch_v1: 5012@2M / 6716@4M / 8278@8M).
