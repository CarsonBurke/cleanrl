# PPO + IterThink v24 Beta + d3bucket MTP + PPO-ADVNORM(batch) + NEXTLAT + UNCW v3.
# =====================================================================================
# V3 DELTA (vs nextlat_v1): NLL *WITH* HL-GAUSS -- i.e. the critic is UNCHANGED.
# HL-Gauss cross-entropy already IS negative log-likelihood: the NLL of a
# categorical return model under Gaussian-smoothed targets. v2 confounded the
# representation (buckets -> unimodal Gaussian) with the objective (CE -> NLL);
# v3 keeps the proven 511-bucket Dreamer3-symexp MTP head and CE loss bit-for-bit
# and adds exactly ONE idea: the critic's own spread sigma(s) (the h0 bucket std
# in raw-return units, already computed for tanh_std shaping) precision-weights
# the policy GAE BEFORE shaping/normalization:
#         w_i = P_i^p / mean(P^p),  P_i = 1/sigma(s_i)^2,
# scale-free inverse-variance weights (p=1): certain states steer proportionally
# more, global scale exactly preserved (mean-1) into batch norm_adv.
# `--no-unc-weight-adv` is bit-identical to nextlat_v1 (no new params are added,
# so inits and the RNG stream are untouched; only two log scalars are added).
# HYPOTHESIS: the bucket critic already knows what it doesn't know; trusting
# certain states more converts that knowledge into returns with zero
# representation risk. Falsifiable vs nextlat_v1_clip025 (@4M 8535): if v3 <= it,
# the weighting distorts a healthy advantage stream and should be dropped.
# DEFAULT: nextlat_grad_clip=0.25 (the clip025 run's value, not v1's 0.1).
# Watch: debug/unc_weight_std (differentiation -- 0 means the weights went uniform),
# debug/sigma_over_retstd (calibration). No nll_mse (no Gaussian mean).

# PPO + IterThink v24 Beta + d3bucket MTP + PPO-ADVNORM(batch) + NEXTLAT (paper-aligned) v1.
# =====================================================================================
# NEXTLAT: the PAPER-ALIGNED one-step/multi-step next-latent prediction auxiliary
# (arXiv:2511.05963 "NextLat"), ported faithfully to this PPO base as the CONTROL arm
# against latenttd_v1 (TD/lambda-return latent self-prediction). Mapping to control:
#   - latent h_t = final trunk output (paper: final-layer pre-logit hidden), the same
#     H-dim feature the Beta action heads consume.
#   - "next token" X_{t+1} -> the ACTION a_t: in an MDP rollout the action is the new
#     input that drives h_t -> h_{t+1}. (Conditioning on o_{t+1} would be trivial here:
#     the encoder is stateless, so h_{t+1} is a function of o_{t+1} alone.)
#   - latent dynamics model p_psi = simple MLP([h, a] -> h_next), rolled out to depth d
#     with ALL intermediate steps supervised (paper Sec. 3): h_hat_{t+i} vs
#     sg[h_{t+i}], Smooth L1, RAW latents (paper uses no latent normalization, no EMA,
#     no snapshot -- targets are ONLINE stop-grad recomputes of the current trunk).
#   - KL distillation term (paper Eq. 4, "agreement in token-prediction space"): our
#     token space is the ACTION distribution, so KL( pi(.|sg h_{t+i}) || pi(.|h_hat_{t+i}) )
#     distills the true future policy into predictions decoded from imagined latents.
# Depth masks reuse the critic-MTP boundary logic (no reset between t and t+i). The aux
# gets ITS OWN dual-backward clip budget (nextlat_grad_clip=0.1 vs actor 0.25 / critic
# 0.25) -- identical budget to latenttd_v1, so the A/B isolates the TARGET STRUCTURE
# (one-step/rollout prediction vs TD-horizon) at matched gradient allowance.
# HYPOTHESIS (control): if the user-observed next-latent uplift is horizon-independent,
# this arm matches latenttd_v1; if the TD horizon is the active ingredient, latenttd wins.
# Watch: losses/nextlat_pred_loss, losses/nextlat_kl_loss, debug/latent_batch_std
# (collapse probe: per-dim cross-batch std of raw latents -> 0 means collapse).
#
# CONFIG NOTE: bakes in the "ppoadvnorm_batch" base config as defaults (norm_adv=True,
# norm_adv_scope="batch", ret_percnorm=False) — the config of run
# HalfCheetah-v4__iterthink_v24_beta_d3bucket_mtp_ppoadvnorm_batch_v1__1__1782008060,
# the bar to beat. --no-nextlat recovers that base's algorithm/config (shared params get
# bit-identical init; the extra predictor draws shift the RNG stream afterward).

#
# --- inherited mbpercnorm_v2 notes (percnorm OFF here; kept for lineage) ---
# v2 = v1 (d3percnorm) but the percentile advantage scaler is computed PER-MINIBATCH with NO EMA
# (ret_perc_scope="minibatch"), i.e. the per-mb analog of the old advnorm. Each minibatch divides its
# advantage by S = max(1, P95-P5) of THAT minibatch's RAW RETURNS (`mb_ret` -- the same return-spread
# statistic v1's EMA tracked, per the design intent), recomputed fresh every minibatch. Same divide-only,
# same return-spread source, same floor; ONLY the timing/memory differs: local & reactive instead of a
# slow global EMA. This isolates the EMA's contribution -- does dreamer3's slow global percentile scale
# beat a fresh per-minibatch one? Everything else == v1: no rankgauss (adv_transform="v10"), norm_adv off,
# raw reward, RAW-space Dreamer3 511-bucket symexp critic, PPO clip-higher (0.2/0.28) trust region.
# (--ret-perc-scope ema reproduces v1's global-EMA scaler exactly.) Watch charts/ret_perc_scale (now the
# last minibatch's S) -- expect it ~v1's magnitude (return spread is value-dominated, stable across mbs of
# 1024 samples) but noisier/reactive vs v1's EMA-smoothed value.
# =====================================================================================
#
# --- v1 method (changes vs the base, retained below) ---
# Variant of v162critic_dreamer3bucket_hlgauss_mtp_v1: ports DreamerV3's advantage-scale
# stack (as in dg_beta v15/v16) onto this MTP base. THREE changes vs the base:
#   (1) NO rankgauss: adv_transform="v10" (identity). The base's flagship rank-Gaussian
#       shaping is removed -- it already maps advantages to ~N(0,1), so a percentile
#       norm on top of it would be a constant-divide no-op. ("no advantage norm")
#   (2) NO norm_adv: per-minibatch standardization off. ("no advantage norm")
#   (3) DreamerV3 PERCENTILE NORM is the SOLE advantage scaler: policy_adv <- policy_adv /
#       max(1, EMA(P95)-EMA(P5)) over the raw GAE returns (EMA rate 0.01, divide-only).
# Reward stays RAW (base already defaults normalize_reward=clip_reward=False). The CRITIC
# stays in RAW space -- unchanged Dreamer3 511-bucket symexp HL-Gauss MTP head regressing
# raw returns (DreamerV3 valnorm=none; same arrangement as dg_beta v15/v16). Trust region
# is the base's PPO clip-higher (0.2/0.28), which bounds the step at any advantage scale.
#
# HYPOTHESIS: faithful DreamerV3 normalization (percentile spread + hard floor, raw-return
# symexp critic) on the strong MTP base is at least as stable as rankgauss while being a
# cleaner, more principled scaler. Falsifiable: if it underperforms the rankgauss base, the
# rank-only advantage (magnitude-discarding) was doing real work that a pure scale can't
# replace. Watch charts/ret_perc_scale (the EMA percentile spread S).
# =====================================================================================
#
# --- Base method (unchanged below) ---
# Hypothesis: keep iterthink_v24_beta_s1's PPO/Beta actor and ThinkTrunk, but
# replace the v24 distributional lambda-return critic with the v162 critic plus
# Dreamer3-style exponentially spaced value buckets over v162's raw range:
#   - value bucket centers are symexp(linspace(symlog(-20000), symlog(20000), 511))
#   - HL-Gauss target mass is integrated over the matching symlog-coordinate
#     bucket intervals instead of two-hot interpolation
#   - expected-scalar decode E[symexp(bin)] for values and bootstraps
#   - bias-free neutral critic logits instead of a peaked zero prior
#   - critic MTP head predicting returns[t + h] for h=0..5 with boundary masks
# This isolates whether Dreamer3's high-resolution near-zero / wide-tail bucket
# geometry improves the already-strong v162 critic port, without importing the
# v162 world model, CUDA graph path, or imagined updates.
#
# Base: ppo_continuous_action_iterthink_v24_dist.py / iterthink_v24_beta_s1.
# Critic donor: ppo_continuous_action_iterthink_v162_compiled_wmloss_cudagraph_edgeclamp_contdisc_k6.py.
#
# PPO + IterThink v24 (ACTION-DISTRIBUTION TOGGLE: dreamer4-faithful). From v21.
#
# SOFT MAX-ENTROPY add-on (--auto-entropy, gaussian only). This borrows SAC's
# tanh-squashed log-prob, target-entropy heuristic, and temperature dual, but keeps
# the PPO critic on the RAW reward return. Entropy enters the actor two ways:
#   (1) a current-state squashed-entropy actor bonus, -alpha * log pi_sq(a|s);
#   (2) a policy-only soft GAE whose one-step bootstrap adds alpha * H_sq(s_{t+1})
#       using the rollout/bootstrapped squashed log-prob sample.
# The critic target is deliberately entropy-free so the fixed support remains
# calibrated. In this variant the target is v162 scalar-return HL-Gauss MTP over
# Dreamer3-spaced buckets.
#
# WHY v24. The v22/v23 state-dependent Gaussian std hit a 1/sigma^2 pathology
# (confident low-sigma states spike the mean gradient). dreamer4 avoids this two
# ways, and v24 ports BOTH faithfully behind one `--actor-dist` toggle, on the
# UNCHANGED v21 winner machinery (shared backbone, 2-way decoupled clip,
# rankgauss, clip-higher, tkl03) so the ONLY thing that varies is the action
# distribution — a clean A/B.
#
#   actor_dist="beta"  (DEFAULT, the "performs much better" path):
#       unimodal Beta, exactly dreamer4's continuous_dist_type='beta' (which
#       forces unimodal=True) and our beta_relusq:
#           alpha = 1 + softplus(head_a);  beta = 1 + softplus(head_b)   (>=1 => unimodal)
#       native support (0,1) is linearly rescaled to the env action range
#       [low, high]. Sampling clamps z to [eps, 1-eps]; log_prob/entropy are the
#       closed-form Beta values in native z-space (the constant rescale Jacobian
#       is dropped — it cancels in the PPO ratio and the entropy is a constant
#       offset). Bounded support => no squash saturation, no 1/sigma^2 blow-up,
#       no boundary mass leak, no bang-bang (unimodal).
#
#   actor_dist="gaussian"  (the matched control = state-dependent Gaussian scale):
#       dreamer4's Gaussian readout. This is NOT SAC's exact log-std head. It is a
#       state-dependent log-VARIANCE head (not a flat Parameter, not log-std),
#       SOFT-bounded by dreamer4's tanh-rescale (not a hard clamp, so the gradient
#       never dies at the bound):
#           lv  = rescale(tanh(raw_lv/(hi-lo)), (-1,1), (lo,hi))   # symmetric (lo,hi) => lv=0 at init
#           std = exp(0.5 * lv)
#       then the iterthink/SAC tanh-squash + stable Jacobian on the sample (mean
#       stays raw). SAC continuous-action instead uses a state-dependent log_std
#       head bounded to [-5, 2] and std = exp(log_std). Here logvar [-8, 8] implies
#       log_std [-4, 4], so the family matches but the scale parameterization and
#       bounds do not.
#
# PARITY NOTES (both dists): the rollout buffers the distribution-NATIVE sample
# (latent_zs) — pre-tanh z for gaussian, z in (0,1) for beta — and replays it on
# the update pass, so log_prob is recomputed at the same sample (identical to
# v21's z-replay). `actions` holds the env action (tanh(z) / rescaled z). The
# gaussian path is bit-identical to v21 except the flat logstd -> dreamer4 head.
# Bar to beat: v21 flat-Gaussian = 8774.
#
# --- inherited v21 notes ---
# PPO + IterThink v21 (SHARED BACKBONE + DECOUPLED GRAD CLIP). From v19.
#
# WHY v21. v19 used two independent ThinkTrunks (one actor, one critic). The
# classic MuJoCo-PPO result is that shared backbones LOSE, because the value
# loss gradient dominates the shared trunk and corrupts the policy's features.
# v21 tests whether we can have the representation-sharing benefit WITHOUT that
# cost, by decoupling the gradient magnitudes:
#   - share_backbone: one ThinkTrunk feeds both the actor head and the
#     (distributional) critic head; trunk is computed once per forward.
#   - separate_grad_clip: DUAL-BACKWARD clipping. The value gradient
#     (vf_coef * v_loss) and the policy gradient (pg_loss - ent) are each
#     backpropped and clipped to their OWN max-norm (critic_grad_clip /
#     actor_grad_clip), then summed on the shared trunk:
#         trunk.grad = clip_actor(d pg / d trunk) + clip_critic(d vl / d trunk)
#     so the distributional critic's large CE gradient can no longer swamp the
#     shared features. NOTE: the trunk's effective budget is the SUM of the two
#     clips, so each defaults to 0.25 (sum ~= v19's single 0.5 global clip).
# This is targeted: rankgauss already bounds the POLICY gradient (rank-only adv),
# so the dominant imbalance on a shared trunk is the critic -> clip it apart.
# Built on the v19 winner: adv_transform="rankgauss" + clip-higher (0.2/0.28).
# Both knobs are toggles, so this file also runs the {shared,separate} x
# {global,decoupled-clip} 2x2. The bar to beat: rankgauss_cliphigh ~= 8292 (towers).
#
# --- inherited v19 notes ---
# PPO + IterThink v19 (ADVANTAGE SHAPING — magnitude-preserving + attribution). From v17.
#
# WHY v19. A subagent review of v17 (CDF-rank distributional PG) found that in its
# STABLE regime the categorical critic is overconfident, so u=F_Z(G) is bimodal at
# 0/1, the probit saturates, and the advantage DEGENERATES to ≈sign(GAE) (corr 0.92);
# norm_adv then re-standardizes the ±3.3 spikes to ≈±1 binary. So v17 discards the
# advantage MAGNITUDE (the thing PPO needs) and is really a sign-of-TD-error update
# made trainable by KL control. v17's 5867@4M conflates THREE possible causes — the
# distribution, a bounded/outlier-robust advantage, and KL control — introduced at
# once. v19 disentangles them and adds the principled fix, via one `adv_transform`:
#
#   "v10"      : raw GAE (== v10 / dist_pg off). Baseline.
#   "cdf_probit": v17's CDF-rank u -> Phi^-1(u). Reference.
#   "tanh_std" : A~ = tanh( GAE_t / (kappa * sigma(s_t)) ).  THE FIX. Per-state
#                normalized by the critic's return std sigma(s) (v16's good idea),
#                but BOUNDED by tanh (fixes v16's blowup: tiny sigma -> saturate, not
#                explode) AND magnitude-preserving near 0 (fixes v17's sign-collapse:
#                linear in GAE for |GAE|<kappa*sigma). Note G_t-E[Z_t]=GAE_t exactly.
#   "tanh_gae" : A~ = tanh( zscore(GAE)_t / kappa ).  Robust-GAE CONTROL with NO
#                distribution — isolates "bounded/outlier-robust advantage" from the
#                distributional claim. If this matches v17, the distribution is
#                incidental and this is the cleaner lever.
#
# All paths keep the mean-value GAE. This variant changes the value target from
# v24's distributional lambda-return to v162 scalar-return HL-Gauss MTP over
# Dreamer3 buckets; only the policy advantage transforms are selected by
# `adv_transform`. sigma(s) is the std of the OLD rollout Z(s_t), floored at
# `sigma_floor_bins` bins.
