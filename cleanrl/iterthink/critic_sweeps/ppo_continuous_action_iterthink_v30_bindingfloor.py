# PPO + IterThink v30 (BINDING CHANNEL -- make alpha a LIVE variable). From v29.
#
# DIAGNOSIS (telemetry-backed). In v28/v29 the adaptive temperature was provably INERT:
# debug/soft_adv_std_ratio == policy_adv.std()/advantages.std() sat at ~1.00 the entire run,
# i.e. the entropy-augmented soft advantage was statistically identical to the reward advantage
# BEFORE rankgauss even ran. Three stacked scale-kills caused it:
#   (1) UNITS NUKE: next_value_bonus = (alpha/return_std)*H. return_std grows 15 -> ~200 as the
#       policy gets competent, so alpha_eff -> ~0.0002 and the bonus (~0.001) is ~0.04% of the
#       reward (~2.3). The 1/return_std "fix" actively suppresses entropy exactly when it matters.
#   (2) FLOOR PARKING: H_sq descends 4 -> -6 slowly and stays ABOVE the SAC target -6 until ~4M,
#       so the dual is one-sided-decreasing and alpha rails to the alpha_min floor by ~600k,
#       sitting there as a dead variable for 3M steps.
#   (3) DOWNSTREAM RENORM: norm_adv + rankgauss put the REWARD advantage in a unit-scale frame,
#       so dividing only the ENTROPY side by return_std double-kills its relative weight.
# Net: v29 still beats the 4868 beta champion (~5540) -- but NOT because of alpha; the win is the
# squashed-Gaussian policy with a FREELY-descending entropy. alpha contributes nothing.
#
# v30 makes alpha a live variable to test whether a binding entropy FLOOR beats free descent:
#   - DROP the 1/return_std scaling: alpha is now in the NORMALIZED reward frame (the frame
#     norm_adv/rankgauss operate in), so alpha*H is on-scale with the reward advantage.
#   - REMOVE the alpha floor (alpha_min ~ 1e-6, numerical only): a binding target makes it moot.
#   - LOWER target_entropy to -2.0 (summed squashed scale): the policy's free descent reaches
#     ~-4 by 3.7M, so target=-2 BINDS around ~2.5M and the dual then RAISES alpha to HOLD H_sq
#     at -2 (a true exploration floor, two-sided), rather than waiting for a collapse that never
#     comes. alpha_init=0.05 (normalized) starts the bonus tiny to avoid early peak-pinning;
#     the dual grows alpha into relevance precisely when the constraint binds.
# Hypothesis: a correctly-scaled, binding alpha that maintains exploration entropy beats v29's
# free descent. Null result (ties v29 / the no-entropy falsifier) confirms max-ent is inert here.
#
# ---- inherited v28 notes ----
# PPO + IterThink v28 (EQUIVALENT-ALPHA soft max-ent). From v24 (proven 4868 base).
#
# WHY v28. Porting SAC's entropy temperature to this PPO pipeline failed repeatedly for ONE
# root cause: a UNITS mismatch. SAC's alpha lives in RAW-reward units (HalfCheetah per-step
# reward ~O(1)). Here gym.NormalizeReward divides rewards by the running return-std (measured
# ~16 early, growing to ~100+ as returns grow), so the reward the loop sees is ~0.02/step.
# An alpha calibrated in normalized units is therefore ~return_std (16-100x) off from SAC's.
# Consequences we observed:
#   * v26's "alpha collapse" 0.097->0.003 was NOT a healthy equilibrium -- it was a ONE-SIDED
#     bleed toward 0 (squashed H stayed ABOVE target -6, so the dual could only decrease alpha).
#     It happened to pass through a tolerable EFFECTIVE scale (0.003*return_std ~ SAC's 0.1-0.3)
#     where it learned (3795), but it was switching max-ent OFF, not equilibrating.
#   * Holding alpha at 0.08 (v27) = 0.08*return_std ~ 1.3-4 raw = 6-20x SAC -> the entropy term
#     swamped the (tiny, normalized) reward and PINNED the policy at the SQUASHED-ENTROPY PEAK
#     (H_sq is NON-monotone in sigma: peaks +4 at mu~0,std~1 = max-variance CENTERED actions =
#     near random; H_sq only goes very negative once mu SATURATES, e.g. mu=2.5 -> H~-17).
# v28'S FIX (SUPERSEDED by v30 -- see top): inject entropy in RAW units by scaling the bonus by 1/return_std, so the
# learned alpha sits in SAC's native 0.1-0.3 range AND means the same thing. This keeps the
# EFFECTIVE entropy weight small/SAC-like, so the reward gradient can SATURATE the policy
# (instead of pinning it at the H_sq peak); a saturated policy's H drops BELOW -6, at which
# point the dual finally BINDS (two-sided) and alpha equilibrates instead of bleeding to 0.
# Also: REMOVE the explicit -alpha*entropy actor bonus (it is the peak-pinning term AND cannot
# be scale-matched against rankgauss, which strips advantage magnitude). Entropy now enters
# ONLY through the soft policy-advantage (future-entropy credit, rankgauss-reordered). The
# critic stays ENTROPY-FREE (v24's design) so the linear support fits -- no symlog, no Jensen.
#
# ---- inherited v24 notes ----
# SOFT MAX-ENTROPY add-on (--auto-entropy, gaussian only). Tests whether SAC's
# entropy temperature needs a SOFT VALUE to be coherent on-policy. We bake the
# closed-form policy entropy into the RETURN: r~_t = r_t + alpha*H(pi(.|s_t)),
# feeding r~ into BOTH the scalar GAE and the distributional lambda-return, so the
# categorical critic learns the soft value and the bootstrap stays consistent
# (SAC's soft-Q, done on-policy). alpha is auto-tuned to hold H at target. Rationale:
# an earlier attempt added the entropy temperature as an actor bonus on top of an
# entropy-BLIND advantage (incoherent: the bonus pinned H while the advantage pulled
# greedy) and regressed hard. Baking entropy into the return reconciles the two into
# one max-ent objective. Use --no-norm-adv --adv-transform v10 to isolate the soft
# advantage from rankgauss/adv-norm. Off (default) => byte-identical to the v24 base.
#
# WHY v24. The v22/v23 state-dependent Gaussian std hit a 1/sigma^2 pathology
# (confident low-sigma states spike the mean gradient). dreamer4 avoids this two
# ways, and v24 ports BOTH faithfully behind one `--actor-dist` toggle, on the
# UNCHANGED v21 winner machinery (shared backbone, 2-way decoupled clip,
# rankgauss, clip-higher, tkl03) so the ONLY thing that varies is the action
# distribution — a clean A/B.
#
#   actor_dist="beta"  (DEFAULT, the "performs much better" path):
#       unimodal Beta, exactly dreamer4's continuous_dist_type='beta' (which
#       forces unimodal=True) and our beta_relusq:
#           alpha = 1 + softplus(head_a);  beta = 1 + softplus(head_b)   (>=1 => unimodal)
#       native support (0,1) is linearly rescaled to the env action range
#       [low, high]. Sampling clamps z to [eps, 1-eps]; log_prob/entropy are the
#       closed-form Beta values in native z-space (the constant rescale Jacobian
#       is dropped — it cancels in the PPO ratio and the entropy is a constant
#       offset). Bounded support => no squash saturation, no 1/sigma^2 blow-up,
#       no boundary mass leak, no bang-bang (unimodal).
#
#   actor_dist="gaussian"  (the matched control = "direct log std" done right):
#       dreamer4's Gaussian readout. A state-dependent log-VARIANCE head (not a
#       flat Parameter, not log-std), SOFT-bounded by dreamer4's tanh-rescale
#       (not a hard clamp, so the gradient never dies at the bound):
#           lv  = rescale(tanh(raw_lv/(hi-lo)), (-1,1), (lo,hi))   # symmetric (lo,hi) => lv=0 at init
#           std = exp(0.5 * lv)
#       then the iterthink tanh-squash + SAC Jacobian on the sample (mean stays
#       raw), base-Normal entropy. (#1 soft-clamp + #2 log-var from the dreamer4
#       parity review; the standing entropy bonus #3 was judged not relevant.)
#
# PARITY NOTES (both dists): the rollout buffers the distribution-NATIVE sample
# (latent_zs) — pre-tanh z for gaussian, z in (0,1) for beta — and replays it on
# the update pass, so log_prob is recomputed at the same sample (identical to
# v21's z-replay). `actions` holds the env action (tanh(z) / rescaled z). The
# gaussian path is bit-identical to v21 except the flat logstd -> dreamer4 head.
# Bar to beat: v21 flat-Gaussian = 8774.
#
# --- inherited v21 notes ---
# PPO + IterThink v21 (SHARED BACKBONE + DECOUPLED GRAD CLIP). From v19.
#
# WHY v21. v19 used two independent ThinkTrunks (one actor, one critic). The
# classic MuJoCo-PPO result is that shared backbones LOSE, because the value
# loss gradient dominates the shared trunk and corrupts the policy's features.
# v21 tests whether we can have the representation-sharing benefit WITHOUT that
# cost, by decoupling the gradient magnitudes:
#   - share_backbone: one ThinkTrunk feeds both the actor head and the
#     (distributional) critic head; trunk is computed once per forward.
#   - separate_grad_clip: DUAL-BACKWARD clipping. The value gradient
#     (vf_coef * v_loss) and the policy gradient (pg_loss - ent) are each
#     backpropped and clipped to their OWN max-norm (critic_grad_clip /
#     actor_grad_clip), then summed on the shared trunk:
#         trunk.grad = clip_actor(d pg / d trunk) + clip_critic(d vl / d trunk)
#     so the distributional critic's large CE gradient can no longer swamp the
#     shared features. NOTE: the trunk's effective budget is the SUM of the two
#     clips, so each defaults to 0.25 (sum ~= v19's single 0.5 global clip).
# This is targeted: rankgauss already bounds the POLICY gradient (rank-only adv),
# so the dominant imbalance on a shared trunk is the critic -> clip it apart.
# Built on the v19 winner: adv_transform="rankgauss" + clip-higher (0.2/0.28).
# Both knobs are toggles, so this file also runs the {shared,separate} x
# {global,decoupled-clip} 2x2. The bar to beat: rankgauss_cliphigh ~= 8292 (towers).
#
# --- inherited v19 notes ---
# PPO + IterThink v19 (ADVANTAGE SHAPING — magnitude-preserving + attribution). From v17.
#
# WHY v19. A subagent review of v17 (CDF-rank distributional PG) found that in its
# STABLE regime the categorical critic is overconfident, so u=F_Z(G) is bimodal at
# 0/1, the probit saturates, and the advantage DEGENERATES to ≈sign(GAE) (corr 0.92);
# norm_adv then re-standardizes the ±3.3 spikes to ≈±1 binary. So v17 discards the
# advantage MAGNITUDE (the thing PPO needs) and is really a sign-of-TD-error update
# made trainable by KL control. v17's 5867@4M conflates THREE possible causes — the
# distribution, a bounded/outlier-robust advantage, and KL control — introduced at
# once. v19 disentangles them and adds the principled fix, via one `adv_transform`:
#
#   "v10"      : raw GAE (== v10 / dist_pg off). Baseline.
#   "cdf_probit": v17's CDF-rank u -> Phi^-1(u). Reference.
#   "tanh_std" : A~ = tanh( GAE_t / (kappa * sigma(s_t)) ).  THE FIX. Per-state
#                normalized by the critic's return std sigma(s) (v16's good idea),
#                but BOUNDED by tanh (fixes v16's blowup: tiny sigma -> saturate, not
#                explode) AND magnitude-preserving near 0 (fixes v17's sign-collapse:
#                linear in GAE for |GAE|<kappa*sigma). Note G_t-E[Z_t]=GAE_t exactly.
#   "tanh_gae" : A~ = tanh( zscore(GAE)_t / kappa ).  Robust-GAE CONTROL with NO
#                distribution — isolates "bounded/outlier-robust advantage" from the
#                distributional claim. If this matches v17, the distribution is
#                incidental and this is the cleaner lever.
#
# All paths keep the mean-value GAE and the distributional λ-return value target
# (v10) UNCHANGED; only the policy advantage is reshaped. sigma(s) is the std of the
# OLD rollout Z(s_t), floored at `sigma_floor_bins` bins. Pair with target_kl for the
# 2x2 attribution (v10/tanh_gae/cdf_probit x KL-cap). Control: v17 / v10.
